## Mod List Summary

-  Better graphics
-  New weapons
-  New armors
-  Lore-friendly

All from your favorite Fallout games.  
This is the (relatively) lore-friendly modlist you have been waiting for!  
This list is based on Vanilla Sprinkles, but with many mods added that fit withing the limited 'Lore-Friendly' scope of the Fallout universe.  
That is, adding things that either fit into the universe, or can be found in previous games.

## Game Preparations

Once Fallout 4 is installed, make sure you run it once. (Get to the Fallout 4 splash screen, and exit).

- Go to [BiRaitBec’s Modding Guide.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23556?tab=description) 
- Manually download the WorkBase file.
- Manually download the Main Repack files (Part One, Part Two, and Part Three).
- Extract the WorkBase file with 7zip.
- Inside of the Workbase folder, create 2 folders called 'OriginalBa2' and 'PatchedBa2'.
- You should have three folders inside of Workbase: OriginalBa2, PatchedBa2, and PatchedFiles.
- Navigate to your Fallout4/Data folder, Cut or Copy (Depending on how much space you have) these 15 files:


       1) 'Fallout4 - Textures1.ba2'
       2) 'Fallout4 - Textures2.ba2'
       3) 'Fallout4 - Textures3.ba2'
       4) 'Fallout4 - Textures4.ba2'
       5) 'Fallout4 - Textures5.ba2'
       6) 'Fallout4 - Textures6.ba2'
       7) 'Fallout4 - Textures7.ba2'
       8) 'Fallout4 - Textures8.ba2'
       9) 'Fallout4 - Textures9.ba2'

       10) 'DLCworkshop01 - Textures.ba2'
       11) 'DLCworkshop02 - Textures.ba2'
       12) 'DLCworkshop03 - Textures.ba2'

       13) 'DLCRobot - Textures.ba2'2
       14) 'DLCCoast - Textures.ba2'

       15) 'DLCNukaWorld - Textures.ba2'
       
- Paste these files into your WorkBase/OriginalBa2 folder.
- Extract all three Main Repack files.
- Move and combine the "Textures" folders from these extracted archives into the "PatchedFiles" folder.
- Run the installer.bat file inside of WorkBase.
- When it is done, cut and paste all of the files inside of the PatchedBa2 folder into your Fallout4/Data folder.
- Navigate back to the WorkBase folder.
- After all of these steps are complete, you may delete the WorkBase folder.

Note that you **_CANNOT _** use the HD DLC for BiRaitBec’s texture optimization.   
You’ll see missing textures everywhere if you do.
