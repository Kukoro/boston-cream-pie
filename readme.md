## Mod List Summary

-  Better graphics
-  New weapons
-  New armors
-  Lore-friendly

All from your favorite Fallout games.  
This is the (relatively) lore-friendly modlist you have been waiting for!  
This list is based on Vanilla Sprinkles, but with many mods added that fit withing the limited 'Lore-Friendly' scope of the Fallout universe.  
That is, adding things that either fit into the universe, or can be found in previous games.

## Game Preparations

Once Fallout 4 is installed, make sure you run it once. (Get to the Fallout 4 splash screen, and exit).

1. Go to [BiRaitBec’s Modding Guide.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23556?tab=description) 
2. Manually download the WorkBase file.
3. Manually download the Main Repack files (Part One, Part Two, and Part Three).
4. Extract the WorkBase file with 7zip.
5. Inside of the Workbase folder, create 2 folders called 'OriginalBa2' and 'PatchedBa2'.
6. You should have three folders inside of Workbase: OriginalBa2, PatchedBa2, and PatchedFiles.
7. Navigate to your Fallout4/Data folder, Cut or Copy (Depending on how much space you have) these 15 files:<br><br>
    - 'Fallout4 - Textures1.ba2'
    - 'Fallout4 - Textures2.ba2'
    - 'Fallout4 - Textures3.ba2'
    - 'Fallout4 - Textures4.ba2'
    - 'Fallout4 - Textures5.ba2'
    - 'Fallout4 - Textures6.ba2'
    - 'Fallout4 - Textures7.ba2'
    - 'Fallout4 - Textures8.ba2'
    - 'Fallout4 - Textures9.ba2'
    - 'DLCworkshop01 - Textures.ba2'
    - 'DLCworkshop02 - Textures.ba2'
    - 'DLCworkshop03 - Textures.ba2'
    - 'DLCRobot - Textures.ba2'2
    - 'DLCCoast - Textures.ba2'
    - 'DLCNukaWorld - Textures.ba2'<br><br>
8. Paste these files into your WorkBase/OriginalBa2 folder.
9. Extract all three Main Repack files.
10. Move and combine the "Textures" folders from these extracted archives into the "PatchedFiles" folder.
11. Run the installer.bat file inside of WorkBase.
12. When it is done, cut and paste all of the files inside of the PatchedBa2 folder into your Fallout4/Data folder.
13. Navigate back to the WorkBase folder.
14. After all of these steps are complete, you may delete the WorkBase folder.

Note that you **_CANNOT _** use the HD DLC for BiRaitBec’s texture optimization.   
You’ll see missing textures everywhere if you do.
