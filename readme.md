Pirated games and mods are **not** supported.

**Modlist Summary:**

Better graphics, new weapons and armors, all from your favorite Fallout games. This is the (relatively) lore-friendly list you have been waiting for! This list is based on Vanilla Sprinkles, but with many mods added that fit within the limited "Lore-Friendly" scope of the Fallout universe. That is, adding things that either fit into the universe, or can be found in previous games.

#
# **Requirements Before Installing:**

- Current build version of Wabbajack. This can be found on the Wabbajack Discord linked above.
- Clean install of Fallout 4, with all DLCs **except** HD DLC. Non-negotiable.
- A Nexusmods account. Premium is highly recommended for automatic download support.

Go to [BiRaitBec's Modding Guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23556?tab=description) page.
Manually download the WorkBase file.
Manually download the Main Repack files (Part One, Part Two, and Part Three).
Extract the WorkBase file with 7zip.
Inside of the Workbase folder, create 2 folders called 'OriginalBa2' and 'PatchedBa2'.
You should have three folders inside of Workbase: OriginalBa2, PatchedBa2, and PatchedFiles.
Navigate to to your Fallout4/Data folder, Cut or Copy (Depending on how much space you have) these 15 files:

'Fallout4 - Textures1.ba2'
'Fallout4 - Textures2.ba2'
'Fallout4 - Textures3.ba2'
'Fallout4 - Textures4.ba2'
'Fallout4 - Textures5.ba2'
'Fallout4 - Textures6.ba2'
'Fallout4 - Textures7.ba2'
'Fallout4 - Textures8.ba2'
'Fallout4 - Textures9.ba2'
'DLCworkshop01 - Textures.ba2'
'DLCworkshop02 - Textures.ba2'
'DLCworkshop03 - Textures.ba2'
'DLCRobot - Textures.ba2'
'DLCCoast - Textures.ba2'
'DLCNukaWorld - Textures.ba2'

Paste these files into your WorkBase/OriginalBa2 folder.
Extract all three Main Repack files.
Move the "Textures" folders from these extracted archives into the "PatchedFiles" folder.
Run the installer.bat file inside of WorkBase.
When it is done, cut and paste all of the files inside of the PatchedBa2 folder into your Fallout4/Data folder.
After pasting those files, you may Delete the WorkBase folder.

Note that you CANNOT use the HD DLC for BiRaitBec’s texture optimization. You’ll see missing textures everywhere if you do.

# **Installation Instructions:**

- Download the latest version of Wabbajack.
- Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).
- Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.

- Download the newest Boston Cream Pie file from the Release channel.
- Place the modlist file into a new folder (example: D:\Wabbajack\downloaded\_mod\_lists)
- Launch Wabbajack.exe
- Select "Install a Modlist"
- Choose the BostonCreamPie.wabbajack file you just downloaded.

- In "Installation Location" choose a blank folder at the root of a drive (example: D:\Boston Cream Pie). This location **CANNOT** be where you have the Wabbajack.exe located.
- The "Download Location" will update automatically. You can change it if you wish.
- Click the "Play" arrow.
- Make sure to accept the Nexus API request if your browser asks for it.
- When Wabbajack completes the installation (you can check the Wabbajack.exe.log to confirm it completed successfully), you may close the program.

# _ **Post Installation Instructions:** _

- Navigate back to your Boston Cream Pie installation folder.
- Open "Game Folder Files"
- Copy everything in this folder.
- Paste it into your Fallout 4 directory (steam/steamapps/common/Fallout 4).

Go to the guide [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17EBYwLjiOW5pohAg2vqZS1rO_RGlrZai5nTv6sFAXGg/edit?usp=sharing) for FO4 Config instructions

**That's it!** Launch Mod Organizer 2 inside the Boston Cream Pie folder. From now on, launch Fallout 4 via the "F4SE" option.

If you want to avoid the hassle of future updates from Bethesda, open Steam, right-click Fallout 4 in your Library, open Properties, go to the Updates tab, and change the Automatic Update option to "Only update this game when I launch it." Make sure Steam is launched and logged in before launching Fo4 with F4SE or else Steam will launch the native way and force an update should there be one available. Since we're always launching from F4SE, it will never automatically update again should you do as I have just instructed.

**Special thanks to AUGSpeed and Lively for creation of this readme!**

Now, we still have a little bit of work left to do, but we&#39;re almost done. Now we can launch the game. Once you finish character customization, you'll have three options when you try to leave.

- **This is a dream** : You will wake up in Vault 111. Nora is not your wife. Codsworth is not your robot. You're just a random Pre-war Sanctuary citizen.
- **This is a memory, I don't want to relive this** : You wake up in Vault 111 as Nate or Nora. Everything else is normal.
- **This is a memory, stay here a while** : Vanilla Fallout 4 intro.
